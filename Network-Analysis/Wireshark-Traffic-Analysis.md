# Packet Capture & Analysis

## Objective

The aim of this project is to capture and analyze network traffic using **Wireshark** in order to understand  normal network behavior and identify potential security risks such as unencrypted communication and suspicious traffic patterns.

##  Tools and Environment

* **Operating System:** Windows 10
* **Network Interface:** Wi-Fi
* **Packet Analyzer:** Wireshark
---

## Methodology

### Step 1: Launch Wireshark

* Wireshark was installed and launched
* The active **Wi-Fi interface** was selected because it showed live traffic activity.

### Step 2: Start Packet Capture

* Packet capture was started by clicking the **Start (shark fin)** icon.
* Normal network activity was generated by:

  * Pinging `8.8.8.8`
  * Browsing websites such as Google and icanhazip.com


### Step 3: Apply Display Filters

To isolate relevant traffic, the following display filters were applied:
- dns
- ip.addr == 8.8.8.8
  
These filters helped focus only on packets required for this analysis

## Step 4 ICMP Packet Analysis (Ping)

### Step 4.1: Identify ICMP Traffic from the ping command

* The display filter `ip.addr==8.8.8.8` was applied.
* ICMP Echo Request and Echo Reply packets were observed.

### Step 4.2: Packet Details Observed

* **Source IP:** `10.29.6.195` (local machine)
* **Destination IP:** `8.8.8.8` (Google DNS)
* **Protocol:** ICMP

  * Type 8 – Echo Request
  * Type 0 – Echo Reply

### Step 4.3: Analysis

* Each Echo Request had a corresponding Echo Reply.
* Sequence numbers increased correctly.
* No packet loss was observed.
* TTL values indicated normal routing behavior.

### Step 4.4: Security Relevance

* ICMP is used for diagnostics and connectivity testing.
* Attackers may abuse ICMP for reconnaissance.
* Secure networks often restrict ICMP traffic.

##  Step 5. DNS Packet Analysis

### Step 5.1: Identify DNS Traffic

* The display filter `dns` was applied.
* DNS queries and responses were captured.

### Step 5.2: Packet Details Observed

* **Machine IP:** `10.29.6.195`
* **DNS Server IP:** `10.29.6.167`
* **Transport Protocol:** UDP (Port 53)

### Step 5.3: Domains Resolved

* `www.google.com`
* `ipv4.icanhazip.com`
* `graph.facebook.com`

### Step 5.4: Record Types Observed

* **A Records:** Resolve domain names to IPv4 addresses
* **HTTPS Records:** Indicate HTTPS service capability

### Step 5.5: Analysis

* Modern browsers request HTTPS and A records together.
* Multiple IP addresses indicate load balancing.
* DNS traffic reveals visited domains even when HTTPS is used.

### Step 5.6: Security Relevance

* DNS monitoring helps detect:

  * Malware command-and-control traffic
  * Phishing domains
  * DNS tunneling

##  Results

* Successful capture of ICMP and DNS traffic.
* Clear understanding of request–response behavior.
* Identification of real-world domains and services.
* Demonstrated ability to analyze packets across OSI layers.
