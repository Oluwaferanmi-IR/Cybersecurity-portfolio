# Vulnerability Scanning Using Nmap

## Objective
To identify open ports, running services, and potential attack surfaces on a target system using network scanning techniques.

## Tools Used
- Nmap
- Kali Linux

## Environment
- Local test network
- Authorized scanning target

## Methodology
1. Identified target IP address
2. Performed SYN scan and service version detection using: nmap -sV 192.168.0.159
3. Analyzed scan results for exposed services

## Results
- Port 443 (SSL/HTTP): Open
- Port 80 (HTTP): Open
- Service versions detected

## Risk Analysis
Open ports and exposed services increase the attack surface and may be exploited if services are outdated or misconfigured.

## Mitigation Recommendations
- Close unused ports
- Apply firewall restrictions
- Keep services updated with security patches

## Conclusion
This project highlights how attackers perform reconnaissance and how defenders can use vulnerability scanning to proactively secure systems.
