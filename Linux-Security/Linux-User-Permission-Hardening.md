# Linux User and Permission Hardening

## Overview
This project demonstrates practical techniques for ** creating linux users and hardening Linux user permissions** to reduce unauthorized access, privilege abuse, and security misconfigurations. It focuses on applying the **principle of least privilege** to ensure only users with right amount of authorization can access information.

## Objective
- Understand Linux file and directory permissions
- Harden user and group access
- Restrict unauthorized privilege escalation
- Secure sensitive system files
- Demonstrate Linux hardening techniques 

## Tools Used
- Linux Command Line Interface
- Kali Linux

## 🔐 Permission Basics

### File Permission Structure
text
-rwxr-x---
│ │ │ │
│ │ │ └── Others permissions
│ │ └──── Group permissions
│ └────── User (Owner) permissions
└──────── File type
## Methodology


## Findings
- Default permissions may allow unauthorized access
- Excessive sudo privileges increase risk

## Security Impact
Proper permission management prevents privilege escalation and unauthorized system changes.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates basic system hardening techniques that reduce the risk of insider threats and compromised user accounts.
