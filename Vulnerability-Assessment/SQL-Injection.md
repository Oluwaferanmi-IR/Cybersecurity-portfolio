# SQL Injection Practice Lab 

##  Project Overview
This project documents my hands-on practice and understanding of **SQL Injection (SQLi)** vulnerabilities using intentionally vulnerable web applications:
- **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)**
- **OWASP Juice Shop**

The goal of this lab is to understand:
- What SQL Injection is
- Why it occurs
- How to identify SQL injection vulnerabilities using **logic-based testing**
- How modern applications can still be vulnerable
- How SQL injection can be prevented
  
---

### What is SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language used by applications to talk to data in order to:
- Retrieve data
- Insert data
- Update data
- Delete data

### What is SQL Injection?
SQL Injection is a vulnerability where user input is treated a SQL command instead of a plain data. This allows attackers to change the logic of the database query. The mistaken sql command is executed because it fails to separate user input from SQL code.

##  Methodology 

### Step 1: Input Identification
I identified application inputs that:
- Influence database queries
- Control authentication or data retrieval
- Act as decision-making points (e.g. login, search, filters)

### Step 2: Baseline Behavior
For each input:
- Normal values were submitted
- Expected behavior was observed and noted
This baseline is what i used for comparison to detect possile sql vulnerability.

### Step 3: Logic-Based Anomaly Testing
Instead of relying on error messages, I tested whether:
- Input could change query logic by inputing some basic sql test command like (' OR' 1=1) (1' and 1-1#)
Behavioral changes indicated SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

### Step 4: Confirmation
SQL Injection was confirmed when:
- Application decisions changed unexpectedly
- Filters or restrictions were bypassed
- Input influenced backend logic instead of being treated as data

##  Observations

- SQL Injection is a **server-side vulnerability**
- SQLi does not depend on special characters but on **logic manipulation**
- Modern frameworks are not immune if queries are built unsafely
- Error suppression does not eliminate SQL Injection
- Logic-based testing is critical in modern applications

---

## 🔐 Mitigation & Prevention

To prevent SQL Injection:
- Use **parameterized queries / prepared statements**
- Avoid dynamic SQL concatenation
- Apply least-privilege database access
- Implement proper error handling
- Perform regular security testing
