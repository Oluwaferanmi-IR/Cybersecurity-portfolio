## Project: Network Traffic Analysis Using Wireshark

### Objective
Capture and analyze network traffic to identify protocols and potential risks.

### Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Wireshark

### Steps Taken
1. Started Wireshark on Kali Linux
2. Captured traffic on active network interface
3. Applied filters (tcp, dns, http)
4. Inspected packets

### Findings
- Observed TCP handshakes
- Identified DNS requests
- Detected unencrypted HTTP traffic

### Security Impact
Unencrypted traffic can expose sensitive data.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates basic packet analysis and security awareness.
