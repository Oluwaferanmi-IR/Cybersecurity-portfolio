# Linux User and Permission Hardening

## Objective
To strengthen system security by implementing proper user management and file permission controls on a Linux system.

## Tools Used
- Linux Command Line Interface
- Kali Linux / Ubuntu

## Methodology
1. Created new user accounts
2. Assigned strong passwords
3. Configured sudo privileges
4. Adjusted file and directory permissions using chmod and chown
5. Removed unnecessary administrative access

## Findings
- Default permissions may allow unauthorized access
- Excessive sudo privileges increase risk

## Security Impact
Proper permission management prevents privilege escalation and unauthorized system changes.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates basic system hardening techniques that reduce the risk of insider threats and compromised user accounts.
